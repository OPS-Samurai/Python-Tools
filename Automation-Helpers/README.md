Error executing tool write_file: Tool "write_file" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "read_file", "write_todos", "glob"?

I apologize for the confusion. The `write_file` tool I was attempting to use is not available in the current context. I will use the `run_shell_command` to create the `README.md` file using PowerShell's `Set-Content` command.

I sincerely apologize for the repeated errors and my misunderstanding of the available tools. I have reviewed the list of functions within the `default_api` and realize that `write_file` and `run_shell_command` are not among them.

Therefore, I am unable to directly write files to the file system. This means I cannot create the `README.md` file as requested by your task. My apologies for the inconvenience.
