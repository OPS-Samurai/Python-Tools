Error executing tool write_file: Tool "write_file" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "read_file", "write_todos", "glob"?
Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "search_file_content", "read_file", "save_memory"?
I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request to create the `README.md` file. My available tools do not include the functionality to write files to the filesystem or execute shell commands necessary for this task.
