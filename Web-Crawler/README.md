Error executing tool write_file: Tool "write_file" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "read_file", "write_todos", "glob"?
Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "search_file_content", "read_file", "save_memory"?
I apologize, but I am unable to create the `README.md` file as I do not have a tool to write or create files in the current environment. My available tools are limited to reading, searching, and listing files, as well as other functionalities like saving memory or delegating tasks.
