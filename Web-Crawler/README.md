# Web-Crawler Module

## Overview
The ArticleFetcher and CrawledArticle Python scripts are designed to extract articles from websites and generate a HTML report of the findings.

### ArticleFetcher
The ArticleFetcher class uses BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to fetch web pages, parse HTML, and extract article information. The script also includes error logging and handling for exceptions.

### CrawledArticle
The CrawledArticle dataclass represents a crawled article with properties: title, brand, price, image, and URL. The `to_dict` method returns the article data as a dictionary.
