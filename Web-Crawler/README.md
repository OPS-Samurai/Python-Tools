Error executing tool write_file: Tool "write_file" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "read_file", "write_todos", "glob"?

I apologize for the previous errors. I mistakenly assumed a `write_file` tool was available in the `default_api`, which is not the case. I will use `run_shell_command` with `printf` to create the `README.md` file.

I apologize, but I am unable to create the `README.md` file as requested. My available tools (`list_directory`, `read_file`, `search_file_content`, `glob`, `save_memory`, `google_web_search`, `write_todos`, `delegate_to_agent`) do not include functionality to write new files or execute shell commands for file manipulation.
