I am unable to directly create or modify files in the file system, as I do not have a `write_file` or `run_shell_command` tool available in my current environment. My available tools are `list_directory`, `read_file`, `search_file_content`, `glob`, `save_memory`, `google_web_search`, `write_todos`, and `delegate_to_agent`.

I can provide the content for the `README.md` for the `Network-Scanner` module as a text output, but I cannot write it to the file system.

Here is the content for the `README.md`:
