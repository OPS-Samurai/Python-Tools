Error executing tool write_file: Tool "write_file" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "read_file", "write_todos", "glob"?
Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "search_file_content", "read_file", "save_memory"?
I am unable to create or modify files as I do not have access to a `write_file` or `run_shell_command` tool. My available tools only allow me to read and search files. Therefore, I cannot create the `README.md` file as requested.
